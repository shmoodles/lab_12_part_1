	<h1>Where No Fan Has Gone Before</h1> <p>A sexy mistake. Tell them I hate them. Also Zoidberg.</p> <h2>Xmas Story</h2> <p>Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very&hellip; Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh&hellip; also, comes with double prize money. You're going back for the Countess, aren't you?</p> <ul> <li>You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!</li> <li>No, just a regular mistake.</li> </ul> <h3>Anthology of Interest I</h3> <p>With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. You know, I was God once.</p> <h4>Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences</h4> <p>Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Can we have Bender Burgers again?</p> <ol> <li>Soon enough.</li> <li>Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.</li> <li>Can we have Bender Burgers again?</li> </ol> <h5>Time Keeps on Slippin'</h5> <p>Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!</p>
